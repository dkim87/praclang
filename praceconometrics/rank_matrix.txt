The row rank and the column rank are always equal.

print(row_rank==column_rank) // True

The largest possible rank for a matrix is either the number of rows or the number of columns, whichever is smaller.

full_rank = min(row_num,column_num)

Whenever a rank of a matrix is of less than its largest possible value, we would say that the matrix was of less than full rank and/or that its columns were linearly dependent.

iif(matrix.linear_dependent == True)
    print(matrix.rank<matrix.full_rank) // True

Two vectors in the xy-plane are linearly dependent if they don't span the plane - i.e. they lie on one common line, i.e. they are either parallel or anti-parallel, i.e. either is a multiple of the other. And the equation of that line expresses their linear dependence.

class eg
if span(vector[2] x,vector[2] y).dimension != 2 : // That is, plane
    print( isParallel(x,y) or isAntiParallel(x,y) // True

Similarly, three vectors in xyz-space are linearly dependent if they don't span the space - i.e. if they lie on one common plane. And the equation of that plane expresses their linear dependence.

class eg
if span(vector[3] x,vector[3] y).dimension != 3 : // That is, space
    print( isParallel(x,y) or isAntiParallel(x,y) // True
