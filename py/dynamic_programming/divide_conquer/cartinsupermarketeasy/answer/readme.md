# conclusion

seems like the output files generated by

print2D and printDP are no different from each other.

Therefore, dp does not change and this is indeed divide and conquer, dynamic programming.

I was keep on wondering if the 105 x 105 table dp changes depending on the value of N, K, but it was (fortunately) not the case.

Thank you so much and this is the best reason I should understand
