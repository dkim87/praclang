##1.10 External Variables and Scope

### Q. What is the difference between Definition and declaration?

A. definition refers to the place (or line) where the variable is created or assigned storage; declaration refers to places where the nature of the variable is stated but no storage is allocated.

### Q. Explain why the second version of the longest-line program is inferior to the first.

A. unnecessary usage of external variables is avoided (it leads to programs whose data connections are not all obvious - varariables can be changed in unexpected and even inadvertent ways), and it destroys the generality of two useful functions by writing into them the names of the variables they manipulate.

### Q. What is the difference beween a variable and a symbolic parameter? (Exercise 1-20)

### Q. What is tab stop? How can it be emulated by blanks?

### Exercise 1-23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't froget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly. C comments don't nest.

### Exercise 1-24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)
This is awesome!!
